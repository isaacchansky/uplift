In times of change, when vast groups of individuals feel left behind, there is a real danger create a rift, or opportinty to unify - depending on the environment. Historically speaking, America has been a place of rifts. Urban vs Rural, White vs Non-white, Old vs Young, Native vs Immigrant, and so many more. To be sure, I am in no means suggesting that we sweep these divides under the rug in the name of "progress". No. These *are* rifts, we created them and they will remain. What we must do, is address our differences. And recognize our needs. Sometimes, our needs will be at odds. But we all want the same things for ourselves, our mothers and fathers, our brothers and sisters, our friends, and our fellow Americans.
